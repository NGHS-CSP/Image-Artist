# Image Artist

Welcome to your image editing project. Digitized images become a larger part of our lives every year. Consider
 - magazines and websites,
 - movies and TV,
 - security cameras and satellite images,
 - astronomy telescopes and climate satellites,
 - MRIs and X-rays, and
 - fine art to 3D print.
 
 Your objective is to create original code that manipulates the pixels in photos to achieve a desired effect. You may use starter code found in this repository or elsewhere online ... just make sure to clearly document what was original code and what was appropriated from elsewhere. 
 
 Here are your final image editing requirements
 
- Use GitHub or another method for version control to retain successive versions that document your code’s progress at various milestones. Make sure that your commit descriptions are informative.

- While working toward each success, retain a record of what you tried that did not work, perhaps by commenting out and annotating abandoned code.

- Keep a project notebook with dated, numbered pages summarizing your work each day.
- Include notes about the problems you encounter, what you tried that did not work, and how you solved each problem encountered along the way.

Prepare deliverables. Prepare your artwork to present to your client. Your work should include all of the following components documenting your collaborative product.

- A visual display comparing the images used as input to those produced as output by your algorithm
- Credits for raw images used as input or as part of your algorithm
- Sketch of proposed idea
- Visual display of raw images used in the algorithm
- Sequence of images showing stages of manipulation reflecting intermediate stages of data during the algorithm’s execution
- Array of images showing results from a range of values for a parameter of the manipulation

Paste your responses for the 4 questions below into a new document and clearly label them 2a through 2d. Use screenshots to capture your entire program code, and paste the image(s) into the document, labeling the images 2e. Draw an oval around the segment of code corresponding to the algorithm of algorithms you described in deliverable (ix). Draw a rectangle around the segment of code corresponding to the abstraction you described in deliverable (x). Save the document as a PDF.

Practice Opportunity for the Create Performance Task

- Pick one of the two previous deliverables to write about. “Describe the purpose of your program and describe what the sequence of images illustrate. (Approximately 150 words.)” (adapted from College Board Create Performance Task Part 2a.)




- Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points win that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. (Approximately 200 words) (adapted from College Board Create Performance Task Part 2b.)






- Your algorithm for iterating over images combines the procedures and methods (i.e. algorithms) that you used from the numpy or PIL libraries. “Describe how each algorithm within your algorithm functions independently, as well as in combination with others, to form a new algorithm that helps to achieve the intended purpose of the program. (Approximately 200 words)” (adapted from College Board Create Performance Task Part 2c.)






- Explain how abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program. (Approximately 200 words) (adapted from College Board Create Performance Task Part 2d.)
